## Planning | Development | Problem Solving 
To tackle this Tic x Tac x Toe application, I had to start thinking like a senior developer instead of a junior developer. A senior developer would begin by mapping out the problem first by using DOM's, user stories, and wireframes in order to first conceptualize the components of the game. I began by formatting the user stories and creating the wireframe, then I moved forward to create the DOM. At this point I had a minimal viable product. As a senior developer would, I then created the necessary folders and files in my text editor so that all the code for the application would be organized, then I began writing pseudo code while keeping in mind the components of my user stories. I used HTML to build the skeleton of mu application and moved onto creating the functions for the user authentication interface. I used consosle.log after every addition to the code so that I may expose any problems that may occur sooner rather than later, so that I can avoid having to dig through all my files to find a single error. With each bug or error that arose, I made sure to use all the resources available to me. My main resources were our in-class trainings, various documentations that were related the specific functions I used, search engines, and my colleagues. When I would run into a problem that I had a hard time thinking through, I reached out to my instructors by submitting an issue and referred to the issues que that my colleagues had previously submitted. These problem-solving steps generally helped me resolve the majority of the problems I faced.
